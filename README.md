My topic is - Airbnb in New York. I took dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data . 

Airbnb is the world's largest accommodation booking service. Apart from apartments, Airbnb's list of offerings includes rare residential properties such as castles, estates, yachts, horse ranches, trailers, and even private islands. The Internet site pays great attention to the comfort and safety of travel, therefore, a reliable payment system, a round-the-clock support service and a system of reviews about each host and guest have been created. Since 2008, more than 25 million travelers have used Airbnb's services, sharing the philosophy of the sharing economy - sharing goods and services based on human relationships and trust.


The company was founded by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk in San Francisco during 2008 where they became one of the first to peer-to-peer services that specialized in housing accommodations. The founders were traveling to a conference in 2007 but couldnâ€™t pay for their housing, so two of the founders decided to rent out part of their apartments in order to help pay for the cost of the trip. This sparked their idea. The founders wanted to change the way that people thought about travel. In 2009 they partnered with Y Combinator and expanded its limited offerings. They continued their expansion and capital raising efforts to eventually grow its operations internationally by acquiring Accoleo. Airbnb now has operations in 191 countries and is able to rent out a room, a home, or even a castle for a night or longer.


Airbnb is located in over 191 countries and continues to expand internationally. They have even been able to establish operations in Cuba and other countries where its legality might be in question. By doing this they have created a niche that caters to travelers; including: high spenders, penny pincers and everyone in between.
